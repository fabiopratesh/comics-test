# Marvel API Test

Hello, this is my humble test with the Marvel API.

I decided to use Javascript with React Framework and Typescript because I'm more used to work with this language/framework, and also because it made more sense for me considering the purpose of the application.

I kept the project simple, with nothing more than what was required.

## How to install & run

1. Make sure you have NPM (node package manager) installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Enter the project's folder and run the command ```npm install```
4. When the installation is complete, just run the command ```npm start``` (or ```npm run start```, works the same)
5. (bonus) Run ```npm run random``` to get a random Spider-man story each time the page loads (I was using for testing and decided to turn into a feature)
